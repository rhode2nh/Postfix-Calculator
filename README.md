# Overview
This is a java implementation of a postfix calculator. Each character of the user's input is fed into a lexical analyzer which outputs tokens that are used for processing. A parser interprets these tokens and builds a parse tree with them. Once the parse tree is complete, the final output for the initial expression is calculated.
